    <h3>Workshop Overview</h2>
    <p>
        In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved human or even
        super-human performance in multiple tasks, namely related to language,
        computer vision, and abstract reasoning. However, despite this meteoric
        rise in AI capabilities, many real-world applications that children
        learn in their first few years of life remain too challenging for
        robots. This phenomenon is known as Moravec’s paradox: contrary to
        humans, artificial agents appear to struggle more with seemingly simple
        sensorimotor behaviors than with abstract reasoning.This difference is
        rooted in the crucial role the body plays in learning about the world
        through active exploration and interactions. This first edition of the
        workshop on the Development of Embodied Cognition (DECO) at the IEEE
        International Conference on Development and Learning will explore how
        the body influences learning and cognitive development from the
        perspectives of neurobiology, psychology, robotics, and machine
        learning. To this end, the DECO workshop will include presentations by
        distinguished scientists in each of these fields as well as
        opportunities for young researchers to present their ongoing projects
        and a panel discussion.

                    <b>Prof. Dr. Laila Craighero</b> is a Professor of
                    Psychobiology and Physiological Psychology at the University
                    of Ferrara, Italy. She has done extensive and very impactful
                    research on the link between perceptions and actions and the
                    role that the sensorimotor system has in the development of
                    cognitive functions. She recently published a comprehensive
                    review about fetal and newborn perceptual and sensorimotor
                    development from an embodied perspective, in which she
                    discusses the existing as well as missing results from
                    neuroscience about brain development relative to the
                    relationship between the motor and sensory abilities. We
                    believe this work can have significant impact in the ICDL
                    community, hence why we invited Prof. Craighero to give the
                    first presentation of the workshop.

                    Informatics and co-director of the “Building a Mind Lab” at
                    Indiana University Bloomington. Her lab's work aims to
                    understand how newborns learn to perceive and understand the
                    world. Using tools from AI, she formalizes theories from 
                    psychologyas agent-based models that use deep neural networks
                    to perform the same tasks as humans an animals. Specifically,
                    she situates computational neuroscience models in virtual
                    animal bodies to test how different components of embodied
                    systems (e.g., neural mechanisms, the environment, body 
                    morphologies) drive the behavior of an entire organism. By
                    simulating the development of intelligence with AI, she aims
                    to build predictive, integrative, and embodied models for
                    psychology and neuroscience.

                    physical and embodied experiences shape their cognition,
                    learning, and behaviour across the lifespan. He takes an

                    perspectives (development, behaviour, neuroscience, motor
                    control, computer science, engineering, rehabilitation),

                    patients), and tasks (manual and locomotor).
