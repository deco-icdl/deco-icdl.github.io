    <h3>Workshop Overview</h2>
    <p>
        In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved human or even
        super-human performance in multiple tasks, namely related to language,
        computer vision, and abstract reasoning. However, despite this meteoric
        rise in AI capabilities, many real-world applications that children
        learn in their first few years of life remain too challenging for
        robots. This phenomenon is known as Moravec’s paradox: contrary to
        humans, artificial agents appear to struggle more with seemingly simple
        sensorimotor behaviors than with abstract reasoning.This difference is
        rooted in the crucial role the body plays in learning about the world
        through active exploration and interactions. This first edition of the
        workshop on the Development of Embodied Cognition (DECO) at the IEEE
        International Conference on Development and Learning will explore how
        the body influences learning and cognitive development from the
        perspectives of neurobiology, psychology, robotics, and machine
        learning. To this end, the DECO workshop will include presentations by
        distinguished scientists in each of these fields as well as
        opportunities for young researchers to present their ongoing projects
        and a panel discussion.

                    <b>Prof. Dr. Laila Craighero</b> is a Professor of
                    Psychobiology and Physiological Psychology at the University
                    of Ferrara, Italy. She has done extensive and very impactful
                    research on the link between perceptions and actions and the
                    role that the sensorimotor system has in the development of
                    cognitive functions. She recently published a comprehensive
                    review about fetal and newborn perceptual and sensorimotor
                    development from an embodied perspective, in which she
                    discusses the existing as well as missing results from
                    neuroscience about brain development relative to the
                    relationship between the motor and sensory abilities. We
                    believe this work can have significant impact in the ICDL
                    community, hence why we invited Prof. Craighero to give the
                    first presentation of the workshop.

                    understand how newborns learn to perceive and understand the
                    world. To this end, she recently developed the Newborn
                    Embodied Turing Test, where she can compare the learning of
                    real and artificial newborn chicks raised under controlled
                    conditions.

                    and Cognitive Development at Birkbeck, University of London.
                    His research focuses on how physical interactions with the
                    environment shape cognitive development and behavior across
                    the lifespan. He employs a diverse range of methodologies to
                    study human behavior, including virtual reality, eye
                    tracking, motion tracking, EEG, fMRI, fNIRS, EMG, and video
                    analysis. These data collection techniques are combined with
                    advanced analytical approaches such as time-series analysis,
                    computational modeling, machine learning, and robotics.
                    Through his interdisciplinary research, Prof. Ossmy provides
                    valuable insights into the connections between developmental
                    psychology and robotics, contributing to a deeper
                    understanding of embodied cognition.
