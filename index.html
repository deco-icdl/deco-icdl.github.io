    <h3>About</h2>
    <p>
        In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has achieved human or even super-human performance in multiple tasks, namely related to language, computer vision, and abstract reasoning. However, despite this meteoric rise in AI capabilities, many real-world applications that children learn in their first few years of life remain too challenging for robots. This phenomenon is known as Moravec’s paradox: contrary to humans, artificial agents appear to struggle more with seemingly simple sensorimotor behaviors than with abstract reasoning.This difference is rooted in the crucial role the body plays in learning about the world through active exploration and interactions. This first edition of the workshop on the Development of Embodied Cognition (DECO) at the IEEE International Conference on Development and Learning will explore how the body influences learning and cognitive development from the perspectives of neurobiology, psychology, robotics, and machine learning. To this end, the DECO workshop will include presentations by distinguished scientists in each of these fields as well as opportunities for young researchers to present their ongoing projects and a panel discussion.    </p>
